    <p>chill hop lofi - Let's dig into chill hop and specifically lofi beats, what they do to us how do they work and how to use them when working relaxing or studying. The term lofi comes from the backlash to super hi fi beats when technology was making music sharper and taking or attention and focus from what we were doing, sitting and listening to music and music allone was seen as a pass time and for those who wanted to get the very best experience the hifi movement was born. Listening to a band in the very best quality of sound and sonics was the ultimate goal. Spending more and more to achieve the very "best" sound was the goal and as technology grew along with recording and production techniques so did the hi fi movement.  As technology become more affordable a new lofi movement started this meant producers were moving away from the very thing they had been told to chase for these years and looking for a more gritty and in many ways more real sound, known to many as lofi fi. This movement was centered around the smooth low frequencies of vint and analog sounds moving in the very opposite direction to the digital CD-driven high-frequency share sounds that dominated the market. Cassettes were seen as becoming nostalgic as was vinyl both were commended with their muffle and less ear-picking sounds that were the digital worlds contribution to sonics. Before we knew it the internet was awash with "lofi" sounds and the movement was becoming more and more popular. The daily tasks that needed some music in the background were easily achieved when the frequencies were not pulling focus and when every track was drawing the listener away from their train of thought and down a rabbit hole of music they loved and recognized. This meant for possibly the first time in the music industry path of striving for a new sound the creator or producer was striving for a sound that wasn't seen as catchy or distinctive or even in a recognizable style of a particular artist. The new sound was being made as a tool to be enjoyed but enjoyed n a different way than maybe ever before. This term is now searched day after day on google and fills page after page on YouTube. All help people get away from the silence or disruptive noise of day to day life and into a world of lofi sounds and a soundscape that aids relaxation and study along with less stress and frustration which is so easy to fall into.</p>
