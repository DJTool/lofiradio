  <div className="collapse-content"> 
  <p>Let's dig into chill hop and specifically lofi beats, what they do to us, how they work, and how to use them when working, relaxing, or studying. The term lofi comes from the backlash to super hi fi beats when technology was making music sharper and taking our attention and focus from what we were doing. Sitting and listening to music alone was seen as a pastime, and for those who wanted the very best experience, the hifi movement was born. Listening to a band in the best quality of sound and sonics was the ultimate goal. Spending more and more to achieve the best sound became the goal, and as technology grew along with recording and production techniques, so did the hifi movement. As technology became more affordable, a new lofi movement started. This meant producers were moving away from the very thing they had been told to chase for years and looking for a more gritty and, in many ways, more real sound, known to many as lofi. This movement was centered around the smooth low frequencies of vintage and analog sounds, moving in the opposite direction to the digital CD-driven high-frequency sharp sounds that dominated the market. Cassettes and vinyl were seen as nostalgic, commended for their muffled and less ear-piercing sounds compared to the digital world's contribution to sonics. Before we knew it, the internet was awash with lofi sounds, and the movement was becoming more popular. The daily tasks that needed some music in the background were easily achieved when the frequencies were not pulling focus, and every track wasn't drawing the listener away from their train of thought and down a rabbit hole of music they loved and recognized. This meant, for possibly the first time in the music industry's path of striving for a new sound, the creator or producer was striving for a sound that wasn't seen as catchy or distinctive, or even in a recognizable style of a particular artist. The new sound was being made as a tool to be enjoyed but enjoyed in a different way than maybe ever before. This term is now searched day after day on Google and fills page after page on YouTube. It helps people get away from the silence or disruptive noise of day-to-day life and into a world of lofi sounds and a soundscape that aids relaxation and study, along with reducing stress and frustration, which is so easy to fall into.</p>
